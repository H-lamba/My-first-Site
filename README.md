# Distraction-Free YouTube (My First Web Project)

Welcome to my very first web development project! This is a simple, multi-page website created as my first step into learning HTML.

The goal of this project was to build a basic site that embeds YouTube videos in a clean layout, free from the usual recommendations and distractions.

## üöÄ How to View This Project

Since this is a simple HTML site, the easiest way to see it live is by using **GitHub Pages**:

1.  Make sure your repository is set to **Public**.
2.  Go to your repository's **Settings** tab.
3.  In the "Code and automation" section on the left, click on **Pages**.
4.  Under "Build and deployment," select **Deploy from a branch**.
5.  Under "Branch," select `main` (or `master`) and keep the folder as `/root`.
6.  Click **Save**.

After a minute or two, your site will be live at:
`https://YOUR-USERNAME.github.io/YOUR-REPO-NAME/`
(Just replace `YOUR-USERNAME` and `YOUR-REPO-NAME` with your details!)

## ‚ú® Features

* **Homepage (`index.html`):** A main landing page with image links that navigate to different video pages.
* **Video Pages (`game1.html`, `game2.html`, `game3.html`):** Three separate pages that embed a collection of YouTube videos.
* **Simple Navigation:** A "Back to Home" button on each video page to easily return to the main page.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

This project was built entirely with **HTML5**.

## üå± What I Learned

As my first project, this was a fantastic learning experience. I learned the fundamentals of:

* Creating a basic HTML file structure (`<!DOCTYPE>`, `<html>`, `<head>`, `<body>`).
* Using different HTML tags like `<h1>`, `<div>`, `<img>`, and `<button>`.
* Linking multiple HTML pages together using the `<a>` (anchor) tag.
* Embedding external content (like YouTube videos) using the `<iframe>` tag.
* Basic file organization for a website.
